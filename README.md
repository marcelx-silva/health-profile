# Health Profile

This project was a exercise of a book called Java How to Program written by H. M Deitel. 

## Exercise Statement

**(Computerization of Health Records)** An issue related to health care discussed lately in the media is the computerization of health records. is the computerization of health records. This possibility is being approached cautiously because of concerns about privacy and security of sensitive data, among other reasons. [We will discuss these concerns in later exercises. later]. Computerization of health records may make it easier for patients to share their profiles and health histories among multiple health professionals. This may improve the quality of medical care, help avoid conflicts and wrongful drug prescriptions, reduce costs in outpatient clinics, and save lives. In this exercise you will design a "starter" HealthProfile class for a
person. The attributes of the class must include first name, last name, gender, date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for month, day and year of birth), height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) of the person. Your class must have a constructor that receives this data. For each attribute, provide set and get methods. The class should also include methods that calculate and return the user's age in years, maximum heart rate range and target heart rate (see Exercise 3.16), and body mass index (BMI; see
Exercise 2.33). Write a Java application that requests the person's information, instantiates an object of class HealthProfile for object for the person, and print the information from that object -- including the person's first name, last name, gender, date of birth, height, and weight -- and then then calculate and print the person's age in years, BMI, maximum heart rate range, and target heart rate. It should also display
the graph of BMI values from Exercise 2.33.
